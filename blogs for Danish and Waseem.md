## What is Penetration Testing

- Introduction to Penetration Testing: This section should provide an overview of what penetration testing is, its purpose, and how it helps organizations identify and address vulnerabilities in their systems and networks.

- Types of Penetration Testing: This section should discuss the different types of penetration testing, including external testing, internal testing, and targeted testing, as well as the benefits and limitations of each type.

- Penetration Testing Methodologies: This section should explain the different penetration testing methodologies, including manual testing, automated testing, and hybrid testing, and when to use each one.

- Best Practices for Penetration Testing: This section should provide recommendations for conducting a successful penetration test, including how to prepare for the test, how to interpret the results, and how to implement the necessary remediation steps.



## Why Penetration Testing is Important

	- Introduction: This section should provide an overview of what penetration testing is and why it is important for organizations to understand and implement it.

	- Reasons why penetration testing is important:


		- Identification of unknown vulnerabilities: Penetration testing allows organizations to identify vulnerabilities in their systems and networks that may not be known or detected through other means. This can include zero-day vulnerabilities that have not yet been discovered by security researchers or cybercriminals.

		- Real-world attack simulation: Penetration testing simulates real-world attacks, providing organizations with a better understanding of how their systems and networks would respond to a cyber-attack. This allows them to identify and address potential weaknesses before they can be exploited.

		- Compliance and regulatory requirements: Many compliance and regulatory frameworks, such as PCI DSS, HIPAA, and NIST, require regular penetration testing to ensure that organizations are protecting sensitive data and systems. Penetration testing can help organizations meet these requirements and avoid penalties for non-compliance.

		- Identifying misconfigurations and insecure configurations: Penetration testing can identify misconfigurations and insecure configurations of systems and networks that can leave them vulnerable to attack. This can include issues such as unpatched software, weak passwords, and open ports or services that are not needed.

		- Knowledge of the real threat landscape: Penetration testing allows organizations to understand the real threat landscape by simulating the tactics, techniques, and procedures that attackers use. This knowledge can be used to improve the overall security posture of the organization and prioritize security investments.



## How is penetration Testing Performed

- Introduction 
	Penetration testing typically involves several phases, including reconnaissance, scanning, exploiting and reporting. During the reconnaissance phase, the tester gathers information about the target system, such as IP addresses, open ports and software versions. In the scanning phase, the tester uses tools to identify vulnerabilities in the system. In the exploiting phase, the tester attempts to exploit vulnerabilities to gain access to the system. Finally, in the reporting phase, the tester documents the vulnerabilities found and provides recommendations for remediation.

- Phases of Penetration Testing:
	Reconnaissance
	Scanning / Manual Testing
	Exploitation
	Reporting

	- Implemeting Fixes

	- Restesting


## When should be penetration testing done

- Introduction 

- When should be penetration testing Done:
	- Before deploying a new system or application
	- Regularly, such as annually or semi-annually, to identify new vulnerabilities
	- After a significant change or update to a system or application
	- Following a security incident or breach
	- Before or after a merger or acquisition to assess the security of the acquired company's systems and networks.

## Penetration Testing VS Vulneability Assesment

- Introduction 

- Purpose: Penetration testing is conducted to simulate a real-world attack and test the effectiveness of security controls, while vulnerability assessment is conducted to identify and prioritize vulnerabilities with the goal of improving security.

- Methodology: Penetration testing is more focused on exploiting vulnerabilities to gain unauthorized access, while vulnerability assessment is focused on identifying vulnerabilities without attempting to exploit them.

- Scope: Penetration testing is often more comprehensive in scope, testing not only the technical security controls but also the human element and social engineering, while vulnerability assessment typically focuses on identifying technical vulnerabilities.

- Deliverables: Penetration testing usually includes a detailed report with specific recommendations for remediation, while vulnerability assessments typically provide a list of identified vulnerabilities and their severity.

- Compliance: Penetration testing is often mandatory for compliance with certain regulatory standards, such as PCI-DSS, while vulnerability assessment is typically not mandatory, but is still an important security practice.
